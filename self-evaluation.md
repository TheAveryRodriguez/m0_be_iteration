# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
- The each method seems incredibly useful. When youre working with large sets of data and need to pull or a specific lists or oraganize them this makes it a breeze.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
- I definitely need to learn more methods and practice the formatting of it all. Felt like I was making simple mistakes that made my life harder than it needed to be.

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
- I think talking out loud, and taking things from the top helped me out a lot. I missed a couple thigns and going back over it all really helped.
